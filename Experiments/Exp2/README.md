# Experiment 1

## Getting Started

This experiment run on AWS with 5 server for the controller and concerns (t2.micro).
The web security group contains 100 stopped instances (T2.Nano).
The database security group contains 1 instance (T2.micro)


Execution order of the concerns (From less important to more important)
* Cost (max 1,5/h)
* Firewall
* Redundancy
* Autoscaling (avr load 40%)

Backend architecture
* Each concern has its own server (4 x t2.micro)
* The controller/synchronizer has its own server (1 x t2.micro)
* 1 security group

Frontend architecture
* 2 security groups (for web and database)
* Wordpress (100 x t2.micro, stopped)
* MySQL (1 x t2.micro)
* Load balancer for the web security group

Application of the concerns
* All concerns are applied to the web security group
* Only security concern is applied to the database security group

Simulation of the load
* No load on this experiment

Our software run only one times to calculate the benchmarks
* All t2 instance types available
